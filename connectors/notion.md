> Connect Manus to your Notion workspace for AI-powered knowledge management

# Notion

The Notion connector links Manus to your Notion workspace, turning it into a knowledge assistant. Instead of manually searching through pages and databases, you can ask Manus directly for project updates, document summaries, or specific information.

## Use Cases

* **Project Management**: Get real-time updates on project status and progress
* **Knowledge Retrieval**: Find specific information across all your Notion pages
* **Document Summarization**: Get quick summaries of long documents or meeting notes
* **Database Queries**: Ask natural language questions about your Notion databases

## Example Usage

With the Notion connector, Manus becomes your project assistant. This example shows how to request the latest project updates, helping you stay informed without switching context.

```bash  theme={null}
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.manus.ai/v1/tasks \
  --header 'API_KEY: <YOUR API KEY HERE>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "prompt": "Any new updates on the project status with Manus?",
  "mode": "fast",
  "connectors": [
    "9c27c684-2f4f-4d33-8fcf-51664ea15c00"
  ]
}'
