> Connect Manus to your Gmail account to manage emails with AI

# Gmail

The Gmail connector grants Manus access to your Gmail account, allowing it to help you manage your inbox. With this integration, you can ask Manus to scan, summarize, and identify urgent emails.

## Use Cases

* **Email Summarization**: Get quick summaries of important emails
* **Urgency Detection**: Automatically identify emails that require immediate response
* **Inbox Management**: Organize and prioritize your messages
* **Email Search**: Find specific emails using natural language queries

## Example Usage

If your inbox is cluttered, Manus can quickly find urgent messages. Instead of manually searching through emails, you can use a simple prompt to have Manus scan your inbox and summarize key emails that require immediate attention.

```bash  theme={null}
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.manus.ai/v1/tasks \
  --header 'API_KEY: <YOUR API KEY HERE>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "prompt": "Can you get my emails and help me see if there is anything urgent to respond to?",
  "mode": "fast",
  "connectors": [
    "9444d960-ab7e-450f-9cb9-b9467fb0adda"
  ]
}'
```
