# OpenAI SDK Compatibility

> Use the OpenAI Python SDK with Manus

## Overview

The OpenAI Responses API is a stateful API designed for long-running tasks that require asynchronous processing. We've made our API compatible with the Responses API, allowing you to use the OpenAI SDK with Manus for complex reasoning tasks, document analysis, and multi-step workflows.

Manus handles the heavy lifting while you track progress asynchronously, making it perfect for automation, research, and complex applications.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin:

1. [Sign up for a Manus account](http://manus.im/)
2. [Generate your API key](http://manus.im/app?show_settings=integrations\&app_name=api) from the dashboard
3. Install Python 3.10 or higher

## Installation

Install the OpenAI Python SDK:

```bash  theme={null}
pip install openai==1.100.2
```

> **Note:** We've tested compatibility with OpenAI Python SDK versions up to `1.100.2`.

Manus uses API key-based authentication via headers. Set up your client with these approaches:

```python  theme={null}
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.manus.im",
    api_key="**",  # This can be any placeholder value
    default_headers={
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key"  # Your actual Manus API key
    },
)
```

<Note>
  The `api_key` parameter to the OpenAI client can be any placeholder value - Manus reads the actual API key from the `API_KEY` header.
</Note>

## Your First Task

When working with Manus, tasks run asynchronously, meaning they don't block your program while they're being processed. Before we dive into the code, let's cover the different statuses a task can have:

* **running**: The initial state when you first dispatch a task. It means the agent is actively working on your request.
* **pending**: The agent has paused its work and is waiting for more input from a user. This often happens in interactive sessions.
* **completed**: The task finished successfully, and the full results are now available to be retrieved.
* **error**: The task could not be completed because it ran into an error.

Polling involves periodically checking the task's status until it's either completed or encounters an error. This approach is straightforward and works well for many use cases. If you'd like to see how to setup a webhook with Manus, check out [our guide on how to do so](./webhooks.mdx).

### Creating a Task

First, Let's create a task using the Manus API. When you do this, you receive a response object that contains a unique id for your task. This id is crucial for tracking the task's status.

```python  theme={null}
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url={BASE_URL},
    api_key="**",  # This can be any placeholder value
    default_headers={
        "API_KEY": {API_KEY}  # Your actual Manus API key
    },
)

# Create a simple task
response = client.responses.create(
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "input_text",
                    "text": "What's the color of the sky?",
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    extra_body={
        "task_mode": "agent",
        "agent_profile": "quality",
    },
)

print(f"Task created: {response.id}")
# Task created: a5ej4FnVPLP8Vjvb6FoeAu
print(f"Status: {response.status}")
# Status: running
print(f"Task URL: {response.metadata.get('task_url')}")
# Task URL: https://vida.butterfly-effect.dev/app/a5ej4FnVPLP8Vjvb6FoeAu
```

To find out about the status of your task, you can use the `retrieve` method to get the latest status of the task. This can be done with a simple while loop.

```python  theme={null}
# When task is done, get the complete response
completed_response = client.responses.retrieve(response_id="m2rLPAbg5PW76A7GYWS72B")

while completed_response.status === "running":
    # Wait a few seconds before checking again to avoid spamming the API
    time.sleep(5) 
    
    print(f"Checking status for task {task_id}...")
    task_update = client.responses.retrieve(response_id=task_id)
    current_status = task_update.status
    print(f"Current status: {current_status}")

print("Task is no longer running.")
print(task_update)
```

Once the loop finishes, the task is completed, has failed or is pending your input. You can then inspect the final `Response` object to get the full conversation.

The final result, including all messages from both the user and the assistant are contained in the output field.

```python  theme={null}
Response(
    id='a5ej4FnVPLP8Vjvb6FoeAu',
    object='response',
    status='completed',
    model='manus-agent-quality',
    createdAt='1760348691',
    metadata={
        'credit_usage': '12', 
        'task_url': 'https://vida.butterfly-effect.dev/app/a5ej4FnVPLP8Vjvb6FoeAu'
    },
    output=[
        ResponseOutputMessage(
            id='jxdOzAoH8RxKi45YJvww2a',
            role='user',
            content=[
                ResponseOutputText(
                    text="What's the color of the sky?"
                )
            ]
        ),
        ResponseOutputMessage(
            id='lJLNeZP1bnHE0YsAPq3Vzd',
            role='assistant',
            content=[
                ResponseOutputText(
                    text='Understood, I will provide information about the color of the sky.'
                ),
                ResponseOutputText(
                    annotations=None,
                    text=None,
                    type='output_file',
                    logprobs=None,
                    fileUrl='<file url goes here>',
                    fileName='notion_benefits.md',
                    mimeType='text/markdown'
                )
            ]
        ),
        //...other conversation messages go here
    ]
)
```

The most important field here is output, which contains the full conversation history as a list of ResponseOutputMessage objects.

Each message includes a role (user or assistant) and its content, allowing you to easily parse the entire interaction. You can see a full list of all of the output files and messages that Manus has generated in the output field of the Response object.

## File Management

The Files API allows you to manage file uploads separately from task creation. This is useful when you want to reuse files across multiple tasks or pre-upload large files.

### Uploading Files

To upload a file, first create a file record to get an upload URL, then upload your file to that URL:

```python  theme={null}
import requests
from openai import BaseModel
from typing import Literal

class FileCreate(BaseModel):
    id: str
    object: Literal["file"]
    filename: str
    status: str
    upload_url: str
    upload_expires_at: str
    created_at: str

# Step 1: Create file record and get upload URL
file_record = client.post(
    "/files", 
    body={"filename": "berkshire_letter_2024.pdf"}, 
    cast_to=FileCreate
)

print(f"File ID: {file_record.id}")
# File ID: file-abc123xyz
print(f"Status: {file_record.status}")
# Status: pending
print(f"Upload URL: {file_record.upload_url}")

# Step 2: Download and upload the file
pdf_url = "https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf"
pdf_response = requests.get(pdf_url)

upload_response = requests.put(file_record.upload_url, data=pdf_response.content)
upload_response.raise_for_status()

print(f"File uploaded successfully: {file_record.id}")
```

<Note>
  The presigned upload URL expires in **3 minutes** for security. Complete your upload before it expires.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Uploaded files are automatically deleted after **48 hours**. Reference them in your tasks before they expire. If you'd like to delete them manually, you can do so using the Files API.
</Warning>

### File Status

Files progress through the following states:

* **`pending`**: File record created, waiting for upload to complete
* **`uploaded`**: File successfully uploaded and ready to use in tasks
* **`deleted`**: File has been deleted (manually or automatically after 48 hours)

### Retrieving File Details

Check the status and details of your uploaded file:

```python  theme={null}
# Get details for a specific file
file = client.files.retrieve(file_id="file-abc123xyz")

print(f"Filename: {file.filename}")
# Filename: berkshire_letter_2024.pdf
print(f"Status: {file.status}")
# Status: uploaded
print(f"Created: {file.created_at}")
# Created: 1760348691
```

### Listing Files

Retrieve all files you've uploaded:

```python  theme={null}
# Get all your files
files = client.files.list()

for file in files.data:
    print(f"{file.id}: {file.filename} - {file.status}")
# file-abc123xyz: berkshire_letter_2024.pdf - uploaded
# file-def456uvw: report.docx - uploaded
```

### Deleting Files

Remove files you no longer need:

```python  theme={null}
# Delete a specific file
client.files.delete(file_id="file-abc123xyz")
print("File deleted successfully")
```

<Warning>
  Deleting a file marks it as `deleted` and you will no longer be able to use the file in tasks.
</Warning>

## Working with Content

### Text Input

For simple text-based tasks, use `input_text`:

```python  theme={null}
response = client.responses.create(
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "input_text",
                    "text": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms.",
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    extra_body={
        "task_mode": "agent",
        "agent_profile": "quality",
    },
)
```

### Files

Include various file types in your tasks using these methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="File ID">
    ```python  theme={null}
    # Best approach - use pre-uploaded files via Files API
    response = client.responses.create(

                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "input_text",

        ],
        extra_body={"task_mode": "agent", "agent_profile": "quality"},
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Base64 Upload">
    ```python  theme={null}

**Supported image formats:**

* PNG, JPEG/JPG, GIF, WebP

<Note>
  For images, use `"type": "input_image"` and provide the URL via `image_url`. Include proper MIME type prefixes for base64 uploads.
</Note>

### Multi-turn Conversations

Build sophisticated workflows by continuing conversations across multiple requests. Just use the `previous_response_id` or `task_id` to link to the previous conversation.

<Info>
  **Context Preservation:** The agent remembers previous context, uploaded files, and intermediate results across conversation turns, enabling complex multi-step tasks.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using previous_response_id">
    ```python  theme={null}
    # Initial request with image analysis

<Warning>
  Use **either** `previous_response_id` **or** `task_id` in `extra_body`, but not both in the same request.
</Warning>

## Task Management

Retrieve all your tasks, including those created through the Manus webapp:

```python  theme={null}
# Get all your tasks
response = client.get("/v1/tasks", cast_to=object)
tasks = response.data

for task in tasks:
    print(f"{task.id}: {task.status} - {task.metadata.get('task_title', 'Untitled')}")
```

<Info>
  This returns **all** your tasks, not just API-created ones.
</Info>

### Filtering and Search

Find specific tasks using these parameters:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Status">
    ```python  theme={null}
    # Filter by task status
    response = client.get(
        "/v1/tasks?status=completed&status=running&limit=50",
        cast_to=object
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Search Query">
    ```python  theme={null}
    # Search by title or content
    response = client.get(
        "/v1/tasks?query=financial%20analysis&limit=20",
        cast_to=object
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Date Range">
    ```python  theme={null}
    import time

    # Tasks from last 7 days
    week_ago = int(time.time()) - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60)
    response = client.get(
        f"/v1/tasks?created_after={week_ago}&limit=50",
        cast_to=object
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Response format:**

* **`data`**: Array of task objects
* **`first_id`**: ID of first task in results
* **`last_id`**: ID of last task (for pagination)
* **`has_more`**: Whether more tasks exist

### Pagination

Handle large numbers of tasks efficiently:

```python  theme={null}
from openai import BaseModel

class TaskList(BaseModel):
    data: list
    first_id: str
    last_id: str
    has_more: bool

all_tasks = []
after_cursor = None

while True:
    url = f"/v1/tasks?limit=50&order=desc"
    if after_cursor:
        url += f"&after={after_cursor}"

    response = client.get(url, cast_to=TaskList)
    all_tasks.extend(response.data)

    if not response.has_more:
        break

    after_cursor = response.last_id

print(f"Total tasks: {len(all_tasks)}")
```

<Note>
  **Pagination Direction:** `order=desc` moves from newest → oldest, `order=asc` moves from oldest → newest.
</Note>

**Available Parameters:**

| Parameter        | Type    | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |

### Deleting Tasks

Remove completed tasks to keep your workspace organized:

```python  theme={null}
# Delete a specific task
client.responses.delete(response_id="task_id_here")

# Delete multiple tasks
task_ids = ["id1", "id2", "id3"]
for task_id in task_ids:
    client.responses.delete(response_id=task_id)
```

<Warning>
  This permanently removes the task and all associated data. Save important outputs first!
</Warning>

### Updating Tasks

Modify task settings after creation:

```python  theme={null}
# Update task properties
client.put(
    "/v1/tasks/task_id_here",
    options={
        "extra_headers": {"API_KEY": "your-api-key"},
        "extra_body": {
            "enable_shared": True,  # Enable public sharing
            "enable_visible_in_task_list": False,  # Hide from list
            "title": "Updated Title"  # Rename task
        },
    },
)
```

**Useful for:**

* Enabling sharing after task completion
* Hiding/showing tasks in your workspace
* Renaming tasks for better organization

<Note>
  Update only the fields you want to change - others remain unchanged.
</Note>

## Sharing & Visibility

### Public Sharing

Make tasks accessible to others using shareable links:

```python  theme={null}
# Create task with public sharing
response = client.responses.create(
    input=[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": "Research report"}]}],
    extra_body={
        "task_mode": "agent",
        "agent_profile": "quality",
        "create_shareable_link": True,  # Enable public access
    },
)

# Access the shareable URL
share_url = response.metadata.get('share_url')
task_url = response.metadata.get('task_url')  # Your private URL

print(f"Share with others: {share_url}")
print(f"Your private access: {task_url}")
```

<Warning>
  Anyone with the share URL can view the task and its results. Only enable for non-sensitive content.
</Warning>

### Task Visibility

Control which tasks appear in your workspace:

```python  theme={null}
# Hide tasks from your task list (useful for automation)
response = client.responses.create(
    input=[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": "Automated process"}]}],
    extra_body={
        "task_mode": "agent",
        "agent_profile": "quality",
        "hide_in_task_list": True,  # Won't appear in your workspace
    },
)

# Still accessible via direct URL
print(f"Hidden task URL: {response.metadata.get('task_url')}")
```

### Best Practices

**Workspace Management:**

* Delete completed tasks you no longer need
* Use `hide_in_task_list` for automated workflows to avoid clutter
* Save important outputs before deleting tasks

**Security:**

* Only enable `create_shareable_link` for non-sensitive tasks
* Be mindful of what information you're sharing publicly
* Use environment variables for API keys in production

**Performance:**

* Use appropriate agent profiles (`speed` for quick tasks, `quality` for complex analysis)
* Monitor task status rather than polling constantly
* Batch similar tasks when possible for efficiency

**Error Handling:**

* Always check task status before accessing results
* Handle failed tasks gracefully in your applications
* Save task IDs for debugging and monitoring
